WORMS 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT
====================

**Random object display, weighted by DENSITY and FACTOR variables.**

Runs in full-screen mode. Fill colours, transparency, stroke width and colour and object
type are all randomized, referenced to the weighting variables to try and achieve a uniform look.

## TODO

- Try using logarithmic adjustment rather than fractional powers
